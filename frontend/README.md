## Key Components

- **UploadComponent**: Main file upload interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Gallery**: High-performance image gallery with thumbnail system and infinite scrolling
- **GalleryItem**: Individual image card with lazy loading, error states, and automatic fallback
- **ImageDetailModal**: Detailed view of images with metadata and actions
- **InfiniteScrollTrigger**: Component that detects when to load more content using intersection observer
- **useIntersectionObserver**: Custom hook for optimized lazy loading with configurable thresholds
- **ThemeProvider**: Handles light/dark theme switching and persistence
- **Navbar**: Application navigation and theme toggle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:5173

### Building for Production

```bash
# Type check and build the application
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# API configuration
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1
VITE_BACKEND_PORT=5000
```

## API Integration

The application communicates with the Clustr backend API for file uploads and retrieval:

- File uploads are sent to the `/api/upload` endpoint
- Upload progress is tracked in real-time
- Image gallery data is fetched from the `/api/uploads` endpoint with pagination support
- **Thumbnail Endpoints**: Fast-loading thumbnails via `/api/uploads/{file_id}/thumbnail?size=300`
- **Performance Features**:
  - Automatic fallback from thumbnail URLs to original image URLs
  - Lazy loading reduces initial bandwidth usage
  - Intersection observer optimizes when images are requested
- Infinite scrolling automatically fetches more images as the user scrolls
- Server responses include file metadata and both thumbnail and original image URLs

## Pages

### Home

The landing page introduces users to the Clustr application with quick navigation to main features.

### Upload

The upload page provides an intuitive interface for uploading images:
- Drag-and-drop area for files
- File validation and preview
- Progress indicators during upload
- Success/error notifications

### Gallery

The gallery page displays uploaded images with advanced performance optimizations:
- **Thumbnail System**: Images load as optimized 300px JPEG thumbnails first
- **Lazy Loading**: Uses intersection observer to load images only when visible
- **Automatic Fallback**: If thumbnails fail to load, automatically switches to original images
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Adapts from 2 columns on mobile to 6 columns on large screens
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Seamlessly loads more images as you scroll down
- **Proper Scroll Behavior**: Fixed layout constraints prevent scroll bar issues
- **Loading States**: Clean loading animations and error recovery
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles large galleries (hundreds of images) smoothly
- **Image Details on Hover**: File information overlay appears on hover
- **Click to View**: Open full-size images in a detailed modal

### Image Detail Modal

Clicking on any image in the gallery opens a detailed view:
- Full-size image display
- File metadata (name, size, dimensions, upload date)
- Tags and captions when available
- Action buttons for interacting with the image
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
